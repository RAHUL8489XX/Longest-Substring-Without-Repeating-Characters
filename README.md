# 🚀 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

This repository contains a clean and efficient solution to the classic LeetCode challenge: [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/).

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example:
```text
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
## 💡 Approach

Utilizes the Sliding Window technique for optimal traversal.

A set tracks the characters within the current window.

Dynamically expands and contracts the window based on repetition.

## 🔍 Key Concepts:
Two-pointer technique

HashSet for O(1) lookup

Real-time window optimization

## 📈 Complexity
Metric =      	Value
Time	  =       O(n)
Space	   =     O(min(n, m)) – where m is the character set size

## 🛠 Tools Used
Python

Visual Studio Code / LeetCode IDE

Git for version control
